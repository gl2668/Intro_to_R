# R for Data Science
This is the github repository for a short introductory course to R and how to use R for data science.

The slides and content are a consolidation of lessons and courses that I have picked up over my masters degree at Columbia University.

The course content covers:
- Basic R Programming
- Importing and Writing Data
- Data wrangling and manipulation with `dplyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
