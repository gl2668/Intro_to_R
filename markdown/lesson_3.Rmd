## Normal Setup From Here
library(knitr)

opts_chunk$set(fig.path="images/",
               cache.path="cache/",
               cache=TRUE,

## Required Libraires {.smaller}

- `tidyverse`: Data Wrangling & Visualisation
- `psych` & `ggcorrplot`: EDA & Descriptive Stats
- `naniar`: To deal with Missing Data

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(ggcorrplot, naniar, psych, tidyverse)
```
  
## What is EDA? {.smaller}

- EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis
- It is an important part of every data analysis project
  - It is **a means to generate questions about the data**
  - Look for patterns / initial answers by visualising, transforming and modelling the data
  - Use what you learn to refine your questions and generate new questions
- The **Goal of EDA** is to:
  - Develop a clearer understanding & familiarity of the data
  - What kind of variation occurs within my variables?
  - What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

## Variation of Variables {.smaller}

- A **variable** refers to an observation or quality that we are measuring or understanding
  - E.g. the weight of a person, the speed of a car, the eye colour of a person, gender
- **Variation of variables** looks at the tendency of these variables to change from one measurement to another
  - How does the height of each student vary in a given classroom / how does the daily temperature change in a year?
- Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can provide interesting information
- The best way to understand this pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable's values

## Variation of Variables {.smaller}

- To visualize the distribution of the variable's values, we need to first determine if the variable is discrete (categorical) or continuous
- Discrete variables can only take on a limited set of values, continuous variables can take on an "infinite" set of values
  - **Discrete** <- Gender, Language, Dog breed, Season, etc
  - **Continuous** <- Speed, Height, Age, Income, etc
- Can you think of some other examples?

## How do you determine the type of variable? {.smaller}

```{r}
summary(diamonds[, 1:7])
```

## How do you determine the type of variable? {.smaller}

```{r}
# Discrete
unique(diamonds$cut)
```

```{r}
# Continuous
length(unique(diamonds$carat))
```

## Variation of Discrete Variables {.smaller}

- Use `geom_bar()`, with only one aesthetic

```{r}
# Tall bars denote the most common values of a variable, vice versa
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Distribution of Diamonds type")
```

## Variation of Continuous Variables {.smaller}

- Use `geom_histogram()`, with only one aesthetic

```{r}
# Areas with missing bars reveal values with very low counts
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100) + labs(title = "Distribution of Carat")
```

## Variation of Continuous Variables {.smaller}

- To overlay multiple histograms use `geom_freqpoly()`

```{r}
diamonds %>% filter(carat <= 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) + geom_freqpoly(bins = 50) + labs(title = "Distribution of Carat")
```

## Descriptive Statistics {.smaller}

```{r}
describe(diamonds[, 1:7])
```

## Descriptive Statistics {.smaller}

- **Skew**: is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point
- If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical
- If the skewness is between -1 and -0.5 (negatively skewed) or between 0.5 and 1 (positively skewed), the data are moderately skewed
- If the skewness is less than -1(negatively skewed) or greater than 1(positively skewed), the data are highly skewed

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/skew.jpeg")
```

## Descriptive Statistics {.smaller}

- **Kurtosis**: is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution
- Data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers
- Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kurtosis.jpg")
```

## What are you looking for? {.smaller}

- Which values are the most common? Why?
- Which values are rare? Why? 
- Does that match your expectations?
- Do you notice unusual patterns? 
- What might explain them?

## Covariation {.smaller}

- Covariation describes the **behaviour between variables**
- Refers to the tendency for the values of 2 or more variables to change in a way that relates to each other
  - E.g. `height` and `weight` tends to exhibit covariation since the taller you are the heavier you are
  - Another example is `Age` and `Income` where you tend to make more money the older you get

## Visualising covariation with a boxplot {.smaller}

- Covariation between **discrete** & **continuous** variable

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Highway Miles Per Gallon ~ Class Type of Car") +
  coord_flip()
```

## Visualising covariation with a boxplot {.smaller}

- For **2 discrete variables**, look at the count of the variables

```{r}
table(diamonds$color)
table(diamonds$cut)
```

## Visualising covariation with a boxplot {.smaller}

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = color, y = cut)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = n))
```

## Visualising covariation with a boxplot {.smaller}

- For **2 continuous variables**, use a scatter plot

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, colour = "red")
```

## Covariation between variables {.smaller}

```{r}
# Using the `pairs()` function
pairs(women, lower.panel=NULL)
```

## Covariation between variables {.smaller}

```{r}
my_cols <- c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07")  
pairs(iris[,1:4], pch = 19,  cex = 0.5,
      col = my_cols[iris$Species], lower.panel=NULL)
```

## Covariation between variables {.smaller}

```{r}
pairs.panels(iris[,-5], method = "pearson", # correlation method
             hist.col = "#00AFBB", density = TRUE,  # show density plots
             ellipses = TRUE) # show correlation ellipses
```

## Covariation between variables {.smaller}

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Using `ggcorrplot` package
ggcorrplot(cor(mtcars), p.mat = cor_pmat(mtcars), hc.order=TRUE, type='lower')
```

## Detecting Patterns {.smaller}

- Patterns in the data provide clues about possible relationships
- If a systemic relationship exists between 2 variables, it would appear as a pattern in the data
  - Is this pattern due to coincidence?
  - Can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?
  - How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?
  - What other variables might affect this relationship?
  - Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

## Detecting Patterns {.smaller}  

- A dataset on the eruption of 2 geysers in Yellowstone National Park

```{r}
pairs(faithful, lower.panel=NULL)
```

## Detecting Patterns {.smaller}  

- A dataset on the arrests per 100,000 residents in America

```{r}
pairs(USArrests, lower.panel=NULL)
```

## Dealing with Missing Data {.smaller}

- Datasets are not **clean** all the time
- Most of the times, you encounter missing data, `is.na()`
- You can deal with missing data in different ways
  - Interpolate the data or remove them
- One package that can help you explore missing data is the `naniar` package
  - Visualize your missing data

## Dealing with Missing Data {.smaller}

```{r}
# Use `vis_miss` to visualize missing data
vis_miss(airquality)
```

## Dealing with Missing Data {.smaller}

```{r}
# Use `gg_vis_miss` to visualize missing data
gg_miss_var(airquality)
```


## Exploring Missing Mechanisms {.smaller}

```{r}
# Use `geom_miss_point()`
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Ozone, y = Solar.R)) + geom_miss_point()
```
